## Upgrade your project

Great work! You have created your micro:bit music player. Here are some ideas to upgrade your project and create a more advanced music player app:

+ Add more melodies and increase the range on the shuffle
+ Use the Logo button (or button A+B on the V1) to stop all sounds, leaving Shake to just control the shuffle
+ Use the Logo button (or button A+B on the V1) to play a favourite melody

### Play ▶️

+ Use the logo at the top to select a favourite song
+ How many tunes are there?
+ What happens if you press the logo after registering a favourite and changing the tune?
