## Play a tune

### Open MakeCode

To start creating your micro:bit project, you need to open the MakeCode editor.

--- task ---

Open the MakeCode editor at [makecode.microbit.org](https://makecode.microbit.org){:target="_blank"}.

--- collapse ---

**Tip:** To make it easier to find your project later, give it a helpful name that relates to the activity youâ€™re creating.

### Play melody


You are going to use the `forever`{:class="microbitbasic"} block to make use of the speaker output on the micro:bit (V2 users only).

--- collapse ---
---
title: V1 micro:bit users
---

The speaker output is only available on the V2 micro:bit. You will need to connect external headphones/speakers to play sound on the V1. You will still be able to play the sound on the simulator.

There is a [guide to connecting headphones/speakers to the V1 micro:bit](https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/hack-your-headphones/make){:target="_blank"}.

From the `Music`{:class="microbitmusic"} menu, drag the `play melody dadadum`{:class="microbitmusic"} block and place it inside the `forever`{:class="microbitbasic"} block.

Click on the down arrow next to `in background` on the `play melody dadadum`{:class='microbitmusic'} block.

Choose `until done`.

### Style your song

As well as playing a melody, you can add a picture to the LED display to add some more style!

--- task ---

Open the `Basic`{:class="microbitbasic"} menu and find the `show icon`{:class="microbitbasic"} block.

<img src="images/show-icon-location.png" alt="The Basic menu with the 'show icon' block highlighted." width="350" />

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Drag the `show icon`{:class="microbitbasic"} block into the code editor.

Place it inside the `forever`{:class="microbitbasic"} block **above** your `melody`{:class="microbitmusic"} block.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

MakeCode has pre-programmed icons that display on the LED panel.

The default is a **heart** icon.

**Click** on the heart to see the other options.

**Choose** an icon that represents your melody.

<img src="images/choose-icon.gif" alt="The show icon block is expanded to show the multiple options for icons. After a bit of scrolling the duck is selected from the list." width="400" />

We have chosen this little duck!

```microbit
basic.forever(function () {
    basic.showIcon(IconNames.Duck)
    music._playDefaultBackground(music.builtInPlayableMelody(Melodies.Dadadadum), music.PlaybackMode.UntilDone)
})
```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

When you make a change to a code block in the code editor panel, the simulator will restart.

**Test your program**

+ You should now hear the melody playing until it is done (and then looping because of the forever loop)
+ You should also see the icon you picked displayed on the LEDs

--- /task ---

Well done, you have created your first music program on a micro:bit!
