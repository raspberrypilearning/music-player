## What next?

If you are following the [Introduction to micro:bit](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/microbit-intro) path, you can move on to the [Sound level meter](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/sound-meter) project. In this project, you will use the sound or light sensor to measure the environment around you, you will also create an alarm to warn you if the sound levels get too high.

Click on the embedded project.

+ Drag the red sound level bar up and down, see what happens on the LEDs
+ Press the A or B buttons to change the sensitivity
+ Once the alarm has sounded, click the logo at the top to reset it
